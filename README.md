sky_generator.js interacts with an open photoshop instance to modify several values of the first layer to create a specified amount of unique pictures.

application.py is what allows the program to run in the AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment.

There are a few other supporting files that I did not include due to lack of relevnacy.
